    "<h1>From Image to GPS Art</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "This jupyter notebook demonstrates how to take an image and recreate it as a GPS route for use in navigating GPS art. \n",
    "\n",
    "I feel I ought to start out by stating that this is by no means a tutorial on the best practices of coding and my knowledge of all the components used vary - I am relatively new to several of the elements used here. Instead, treat this notebook as the (slightly) tidied up scribblings and workings as I set about the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all parts are fully automated yet, but the intention is to revist this problem in my free time to better scale, translate and rotate the image to best suit the location.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Setup and prerequisites</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "From here on in, I am assuming you are competent enough in the python language and understand how to get all the required libaries etc. to make this notebook function.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you don't think you are - you can still play with the code: just click in the boxes with the code and push `shift` + `enter` and the code in that box should run (you will need to do it in the sequence it is written).\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the image that you wish to recreate needs to be selected. Here, I have chosen the GRGR 2020 logo as shown in the figure below (this whole notebook came about because of The Ginger Runner's Global Run (GRGR - https://www.rungrgr.com)). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/GRGR2020_ColorLogo.png\" alt=\"GRGR Logo\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want some back story here it is (if not skip to the next paragraph!): I ran the GRGR '19 logo as my  <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/2786773404\">attempt</a> for the GPS art award (which was a 2 hour event). To create the logo, I hand drew the logo in Suunto's Movescount map - it was a one-shot draw and then serveral iterations as I compared the screenshots to a semitransparent copy of the logo and the tweaked accordingly. It was labourious. When GRGR2020 was announced as a week long event full of surprise challenges I knew I needed to have another go at GPS art and I needed a better way to create it! And that, my friends, is how this notebook came in to existance. Right, back to the workings... \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the image should be fairly easy to recreate as a continuous-line drawing and therefore will be easy to transfer to a GPS route without loosing the image's detail. If you wish to recreate a more complex image (for example, a cartoon or a photo) then you will need to dig deep into your creative pocket to work out how much detail you want to recreate as lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the continous-line image, the original image was opened in Inkscape (an open-source graphics editing tool https://inkscape.org/) and a route was traced over the top of the image (using the 'Draw Bezier curves and straight lines' tool) so that all the lines could be linked continuously - note: only use straight lines (as this is needed for the next step. In this image's case it required several repeated sections, which ideally need to be minimised for ease of running (and also the distance will be minimised!). The resulting SVG file can be seen below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/grgr2020.svg\" alt=\"GRGR route\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, the SVG was saved as a DXF (a file format associated with drawing and CAD) using Inkscape. Some key points should be observed here:\n",
    " <ol>\n",
    "  <li>The width of the line drawing should be set to a sensible value for scaling (I resized the line drawings to be 100 mm wide throughout all my designs)</li>\n",
    "  <li>Remove all layers so that the SVG consists of just a path (this should guarantee the LWPolyline will be in Layer 0). This can be done by firstly cutting the line-drawing and deleting everything else in the document, then in the 'Objects' tab removing any layers (highlight it and click the '-' sign at the bottom) and then paste and centre your drawing.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The document should be resized to the path object (this allow the centre of the drawing to found in the code).</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is done and you have your saved DXF file you are good to start working through this notebook.\n"
